# kicad_xilinx_bga_footprints...

... and symbols!

These are all Xilinx Ultrascale, Zynq 7000, Zynq Ultrascale and Versal BGA footsprints for KiCad.

These were generated using a script from the official pinout files, so they might not be perfect but certainly very usable to the amateur (who's got enough money to play around with Xilinx chips of course). If you may need any adjustment, such as a smaller pad diameter, feel free to contact me.

The official pinout files are not part of this repository, but you can find them on Xilinx's website.

(In doing so, I also discovered some mistakes in the official pinout files, but that's another story...)

Footprints **as well as symbols** are provided. However, these are not automatically associated with another.

Also the symobls for the Lattice CPLDs of the MachXO2 series. I just happened to also need these, so they ended up in here.
